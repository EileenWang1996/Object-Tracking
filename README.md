# Intensity Based Object Tracking 

This code was based on what of my lab tasks for COMP3419. The task is to track the X-Y coordinates of a ping-pong ball which rolles on the ground in a video. The approach was to first convert each frame into grey scale and using a pixel intensity threshold to segment the ball. The output video is stored in ping_pong_tracking.mov.
