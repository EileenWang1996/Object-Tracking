# Intensity Based Object Tracking 

This code was based on one of my lab tasks for COMP3419. The task is to track the X-Y coordinates of a ping-pong ball which rolls on the ground in a video using intensity based object tracking. The approach involves converting each frame into grey scale and using a pixel intensity threshold to segment the ball. The output video is stored in ping_pong_tracking.mov.
